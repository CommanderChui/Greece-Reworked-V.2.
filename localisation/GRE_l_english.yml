 greatergreece.26.t:0 "Greece seeks Allied membership"
 greatergreece.26.d:0 "Today the Greek ambassador in London met with our Prime Minsiter telling him about how much the Greek people admire the British Nation and proposed an alliance between our two nations. This could come in handy since Crete could be used as an important naval base for our Mediterranean Fleet and reduce italian influence in the Balkans."
 greatergreece.26.a:0 "Yes, let them join."
 greatergreece.26.b:0 "Maybe not."
 greatergreece.27.t:0 "Greece asks for Cyprus"

 greatergreece.30.d:0 " The Greek foreign minister has met with our President demanding of a treaty be signed in which multiple regions such as Izmir, Izmit, Instabul and others be ceded to its' 'rightful owner', obviously they can't be taken serious.

 greatergreece.30.a:0 "Never!"
 greatergreece.30.b:0 "Offer them 'Constantinople' but nothing more!"
 greatergreece.31.t:0 "The Greeks offer to join our faction"
